# Market Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

This project analyzes consumer data using K-means clustering to develop market segmentation strategies.

## Acknowledgements
This analysis builds upon the Kaggle notebook "Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering" by [Karnika Kapoor](https://www.kaggle.com/karnikakapoor). You can view the original work [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/customer-segmentation-clustering).

## Modifications
In this project, I extended the original analysis by:
- Applying additional data preprocessing steps.
- Incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Refining the clustering approach with silhouette score analysis.
